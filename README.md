Having money isn't the only thing that matters. As Jim Rohn said: "The greatest reward in becoming a millionaire is not the amount of money that you earn. It is the kind of person that you have to become to become a millionaire in the first place." Money isn't everything, but the journey to get there can shape who we are and help us grow.
