Where should you look to keep going? Upward! Or, as Charlotte Bronte said, "I avoid looking forward or backward, and try to keep looking upward." This quote emphasizes the importance of staying focused on the future and looking ahead, instead of dwelling on the past. This is important to keep in mind, as focusing on the future instead of the past can lead to greater success and improved well-being.
