Nobody is perfect. As William Rosenberg, founder of Dunkin' Donuts said: "Show me a person who never made a mistake, and I will show you a person who never did anything". Mistakes are a part of life and there's no reason to fear them. It's important to learn from our mistakes and keep moving forward.
