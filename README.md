It's true that success begets success. As Tony Robbins put it: "People who succeed have momentum. The more they succeed, the more they want to succeed, and the more they find a way to succeed". The opposite is also true: if you're constantly failing, it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. The key is to stay positive and keep trying despite the setbacks.
