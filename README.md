The best way to attain success is to trust yourself. As Ben Silbermann, co-founder of Pinterest said: "Donâ€™t take too much advice. Most people who have a lot of advice to give... Just build things and find out if they work." We should take risks, act with confidence and not overthink every decision. Thatâ€™s how innovation and genuine progress will take place.
