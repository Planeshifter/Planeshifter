Don't be afraid to take the first step towards achieving your goals. As Kevin Systrom says: "If youâ€™ve got an idea, start today. Thereâ€™s no better time than now to get going". Even if you can't start working on your idea full-time, you can always make small progress and start the movement. Every journey begins with a single step.
