Competition is a part of life, but it's not for everyone. As the saying goes, "If you donâ€™t have a competitive advantage â€• donâ€™t compete". It's not just about winning, but it's about setting yourself up for success by ensuring that you have the right resources and skills to be successful. Before entering a competition, it's important to make sure that you have an advantage that can help you stand out from the crowd.
