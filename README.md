You can't just be a businessman, you have to be a business. This is what Jay-Z means when he said "I'm not a businessman. I'm a business, man.". To succeed, you have to think outside the box, challenge the status quo, and create something that will last beyond your lifetime. It's not enough to be a businessman; you have to have the vision and the drive of a business.
