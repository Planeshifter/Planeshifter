Prosperity is not a temporary thing. As the Chinese proverb says: "If you want one year of prosperity, grow grain. If you want ten years of prosperity, grow trees. If you want one hundred years of prosperity, grow people". True prosperity can only come from investing in our people, and in the generations to come.
