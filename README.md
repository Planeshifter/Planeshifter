<!-- <quote> -->

What are we made of? We are made of our habits. Or, as Aristotle said, "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, therefore, is not an act but a habit." This quote emphasizes that it is our habits that shape our character, not single actions. This is important to our daily lives because we become who we are through the habits we develop. To become our best selves, we must focus on developing habits that lead to excellence.
