We all have unique skills and talents. As Albert Einstein said “Everyone is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will spend its whole life believing it is stupid.” We should strive to appreciate and nurture our individual gifts instead of expecting them to conform to set standards.
