Life is too short to live with regrets. As Mark Twain said "Twenty years from now, you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do, so throw off the bowlines, sail away from safe harbor, catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore, Dream, Discover." We need to seize the moment and make the most of our lives.
