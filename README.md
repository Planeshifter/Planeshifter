Complaints don't have to be seen as a sign of failure. As Zig Ziglar says: "Statistics suggest that when customers complain, business owners and managers ought to get excited about it. The complaining customer represents a huge opportunity for more business." Complaints provide us with valuable insights, and if we can address the issues and make things right, the customer may even become a loyal advocate for our business. Quote: “If you can dream it, you can do it.” ― Walt Disney
