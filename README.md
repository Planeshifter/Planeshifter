No matter how hard life can get, there's always a way out. As the saying goes: "If plan â€˜Aâ€™ fails â€• remember you have 25 letters left". It's a reminder that we should never give up and always keep looking for alternative solutions. There's always hope and the possibility to turn our situation around.
