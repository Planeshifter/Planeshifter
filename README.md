No matter how scared we are, we cannot let the fear of failure stop us from achieving our dreams. As Kevin Plank, CEO of Under Armour said: "Thereâ€™s an entrepreneur right now, scared to death, making excuses, saying, â€˜Itâ€™s not the right time just yet.â€™ Thereâ€™s no such thing as a good time. Get out of your garage and go take a chance, and start your business." We can't wait for the ideal circumstances to take a shot at success. We must take the plunge and make our own luck. Quote: "You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. â€• Steve Jobs
