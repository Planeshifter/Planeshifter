The best way to become the person you want to be is to surround yourself with the people you want to emulate. As Reid Hoffman said: "The fastest way to change yourself is to hang out with people who are already the way you want to be." By surrounding ourselves with people who have the qualities we want, we can gain the inspiration, knowledge, and support we need to reach our goals.
