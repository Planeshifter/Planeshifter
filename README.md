Entrepreneurship is a journey that requires you to take risks that most people won't in order to achieve success. As Anonymous said, "Entrepreneurship is living a few years of your life like most people won't, so that you can spend the rest of your life like most people can't". It is going the extra mile and giving it your all every day to create something amazing.
