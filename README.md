We all want to achieve success, but it's often easier said than done. As Howard Schultz said: "Risk more than others think is safe. Dream more than others think is practical." It's a difficult balance, but it's essential to reach our goals. Take risks, dare to dream and don't be afraid to reach for the stars.
