<!-- <quote> -->

Why can't we stay in one place? To get somewhere, we have to keep moving. Or, as Saint Augustine said, "To reach a port, we must sail - sail, not tie at anchor." This quote emphasizes the importance of taking action and remaining focused on our goals. It encourages us to take steps forward in our lives rather than staying in a stagnant place. By adopting this attitude, we can achieve our goals and reach fulfillment in our lives.
