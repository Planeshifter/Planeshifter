Business isn't about taking but giving. Robert Bosch captures this perfectly in his quote: "I donâ€™t pay good wages because I have a lot of money; I have a lot of money because I pay good wages." Good wages should be a priority for any successful business. Workers who are paid well tend to be more motivated and productive, which leads to greater profits for the business.
