<!-- <quote> -->

What happens when someone looks within?  They awaken. Or, as Carl Jung said, "Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside, awakes." The quote encourages us to look inward and be aware of our inner thoughts and feelings. By doing so, we can gain clarity on our life purpose and make decisions that are in alignment with who we truly are. This is important to our daily life because it allows us to make conscious choices that reflect our individual values and lead us to a more fulfilling life.
