Success isn't always about being the best for everyone. According to Ron Shaich, founder and CEO of Panera Bread, “If you can do something to get somebody excited — not everybody — but if you can be the best for somebody, then you can win.” This means that if you focus on being the best for the people who matter, you will be successful.
