<!-- <quote> -->

What did Thomas Edison do to succeed? He failed. Or, as Thomas Edison said, "I failed my way to success". This quote reminds us that success does not come without hard work and failure, and that it is important to learn from mistakes and keep trying. In our daily lives, we must have the courage to try new things, take risks, and learn from our mistakes in order to reach our goals.
