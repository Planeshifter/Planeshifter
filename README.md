Success is not about luck, it is about resilience. As David Brinkley said, "A successful man is one who can lay a firm foundation with the bricks others have thrown at him." It's about taking the challenges and obstacles that come our way and using them to build a strong platform for success. It requires courage, hard work and dedication to make something out of the challenges life throws at us.
