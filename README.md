Jay-Z's famous quote "I'm not a businessman — I'm a business, man" reminds us of the importance of self-empowerment and independence. It implies that we should take charge of our own destiny and be responsible for our own success. It also encourages us to use our resources and leverage our opportunities to our advantage. With determination and hard work, we can all achieve our goals.
