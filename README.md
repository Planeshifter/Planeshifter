Starting a business is no small feat and requires a great deal of passion and dedication. As Dave Thomas, founder of Wendyâ€™s, said: "What do you need to start a business? Three simple things: know your product better than anyone, know your customer, and have a burning desire to succeed." Knowing and understanding what youâ€™re selling, as well as who youâ€™re selling it to, is essential to any successful business. Having the drive to succeed is the boost of motivation that will help get you to the finish line.
