<!-- <quote> -->

Why is it so hard to say no? To be a leader you must be strong. Or, as Tony Blair said, "The art of leadership is saying no, not yes. It is very easy to say yes." The idea is that a leader needs to make difficult decisions and stand by them, even if it means saying no and disappointing people. This relates to my daily life because I often have to make tough decisions and stand by them, even when it isn't popular. This quote reminds me that I am a leader and need to be strong and confident in my decisions.
