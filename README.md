We can't let safety and comfort keep us from taking risks and achieving our dreams. As William Shedd said: "A ship in harbor is safe. But thatâ€™s now what ships are built for". We can't let our fear of failure hold us back from pursing our goals. Instead, we must take bold steps forward with confidence and faith.
