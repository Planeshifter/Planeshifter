You donâ€™t have to force yourself to like something; it will come naturally. As Jeff Bezos said: "One of the huge mistakes people make is that they try to force an interest on themselves. You donâ€™t choose your passions; your passions choose you." So follow your heart, and you will discover your true passion and purpose in life.
