<!-- <quote> -->

What has a dream but must be done on time? A goal. Or, as Napoleon Hill said, "A goal is a dream with a deadline." This means that when you set a goal, you need to make sure you work to attain it before the deadline you set for yourself. This quote is important because it emphasizes the importance of setting a timeline for goals in order to hold yourself accountable and make sure that you are taking action towards achieving them.
