The value of friendships is often measured in the currency of loyalty. As Ted Nicolas said, "Lend your friend $20, if he doesn't pay you back then he's not your friend. Money well spent". It's true that we need to be wary of people who will take advantage of us, but a true friend will always be there when you need them.
