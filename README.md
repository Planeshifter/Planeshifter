Karl (maybe Groucho) Marx was right when he said: "Catch a man a fish, and you can sell it to him. Teach a man to fish, and you ruin a wonderful business opportunity". It’s easy to provide a quick fix to a problem, but if you give someone the tools to solve it themselves, they won’t need to come back to you. It’s important not to make the mistake of giving away too much.
