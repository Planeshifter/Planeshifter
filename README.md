Life is full of tough decisions, and as Timothy Ferriss advises, sometimes it's best to take the plunge and make a move, even if the timing isn't perfect. He said, "For all of the most important things, the timing always sucks. Waiting for a good time to quit your job? The stars will never align and the traffic lights of life will never all be green at the same time. The universe doesnâ€™t conspire against you, but it doesnâ€™t go out of its way to line up the pins either." Don't be tempted to procrastinate, if something is important to you, take the plunge and start now.
