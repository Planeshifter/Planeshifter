Leaders don't rely on coercion to get the job done. As Dwight D. Eisenhower said: "Leadership is the art of getting someone else to do something you want done because he wants to do it". This requires understanding people's motivations, inspiring and connecting with them, and creating an environment of trust and open communication.
