<!-- <quote> -->

Why is a leader only as strong as their team? Because a leader's power relies on their team's strength. Or, as General Douglas MacArthur said, "A general is just as good or just as bad as the troops under his command make him." This quote emphasizes the importance of team strength and cooperation, as a leader's success depends on the effectiveness of the team they are leading. This is an important reminder to stay humble and to recognize the importance of working together, as individual success is only achieved through collective effort.
